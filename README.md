## Features

### **Frontend**
- **User Login**: Secure login for users, admins, students, and teachers.
- **Admin Dashboard**: 
  - View all users.
  - Add new users.
  - Modify user details.
- **Student Dashboard**: Access student-specific information.
- **Employee Dashboard**:
  - Create classes.
  - Assign teachers to classes.
- **Teacher Dashboard**:
  - Add students to classes.
  - Create and manage posts.
 
### **ROUTES**
Three different types of user have different sets of accessibility.
ADMIN: Currently admin routes are not protected.
- http://localhost:8888/admin/create - Creates a new user
- http://localhost:8888/admin/users - Shows all the registered users
- http://localhost:8888/admin/modify - Shows all users and can modify user info
USERS:
- http://localhost:8888/login - user login page
Employee, Teacher or Student if not logged in canâ€™t access routes. Based on login data, user
will get a different interface.
Employee:
- http://localhost:8888/employee/classmanage - creates a class and assigns it to a teacher
Teacher:
- http://localhost:8888/teacher/myarticles - Can create article
- http://localhost:8888/teacher/myclasses - Can see enrolled classes
- http://localhost:8888/teacher/myclasses/_id - Can add students to a class
- http://localhost:8888/teacher/myclasses/t-a/_id - Can take attendance of enrolled students
- http://localhost:8888/teacher/attendance_activity - Shows attendance activity

### **Backend**
- **Server & Database Setup**: Configured with MongoDB Atlas (cloud-based).
- **Environment Variables**: Secure handling of sensitive data using `.env`.
- **Error Handling**: Improved error management for better user experience.
- **Password Security**: Passwords are hashed before saving to the database.
- **Authentication & Authorization**:
  - User and admin authentication.
  - Role-based cookie authorization for different routes.
- **Data Validation**: Ensures data integrity before saving to the database.
- **Relational Database Model**: Structured data relationships for efficient management.
